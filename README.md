# process-jest-test-results

This action works in conjunction with another step that runs `jest test --json --outputFile=jest-results.json` and it parses the results from the outputted file.  This action will take the parsed results and create a Status Check or PR Comment depending on the flags set.

This action does not run the Jest tests itself and it can only process one results file at a time.

## Failures

The status check can be seen as a new item on the workflow run, a PR comment or on the PR Status Check section.  If the test results contain failures, the status check will be marked as failed. Having the status check marked as failed will prevent PRs from being merged. If this status check behavior is not desired, the `ignore-test-failures` input can be set and the outcome will be marked as neutral if test failures are detected. The status badge that is shown in the comment or status check body will still indicate it was a failure though.

## Limitations

GitHub does have a size limitation of 65535 characters for a Status Check body or a PR Comment.  This action will fail if the test results exceed the GitHub [limit].  To mitigate this size issue only failed tests are included in the output.

If you have multiple workflows triggered by the same `pull_request` or `push` event, GitHub creates one checksuite for that commit.  The checksuite gets assigned to one of the workflows randomly and all status checks for that commit are reported to that checksuite. That means if there are multiple workflows with the same trigger, your status checks may show on a different workflow run than the run that created them.

## Contributing

When creating PRs, please review the following guidelines:

- [ ] The action code does not contain sensitive information.
- [ ] At least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version] for major and minor increments.
- [ ] The action has been recompiled.  See [Recompiling Manually] for details.
- [ ] The README.md has been updated with the latest version of the action.  See [Updating the README.md] for details.

### Incrementing the Version

This repo uses [git-version-lite] in its workflows to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge if [source code] changes have been made.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.

| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |

### Source Code Changes

The files and directories that are considered source code are listed in the `files-with-code` and `dirs-with-code` arguments in both the [build-and-review-pr] and [increment-version-on-merge] workflows.  

If a PR contains source code changes, the README.md should be updated with the latest action version and the action should be recompiled.  The [build-and-review-pr] workflow will ensure these steps are performed when they are required.  The workflow will provide instructions for completing these steps if the PR Author does not initially complete them.

If a PR consists solely of non-source code changes like changes to the `README.md` or workflows under `./.github/workflows`, version updates and recompiles do not need to be performed.

### Recompiling Manually

This command utilizes [esbuild] to bundle the action and its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.  If changes are made to the action's [source code], the action must be recompiled by running the following command:

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build
```

### Updating the README.md

If changes are made to the action's [source code], the [usage examples] section of this file should be updated with the next version of the action.  Each instance of this action should be updated.  This helps users know what the latest tag is without having to navigate to the Tags page of the repository.  See [Incrementing the Version] for details on how to determine what the next version will be or consult the first workflow run for the PR which will also calculate the next version.
